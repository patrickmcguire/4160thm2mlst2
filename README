I made use of the example code. For the sphere normals I just enabled GL_NORMALIZE and gave the vector from the origin (where the sphere is translated and streched from) to the vertex and let the library take care of making it work.

The sphere actually looks better with flat shading than smooth shading, which isn't particularly reassuring. I can't see any difference in the phong exponents at this point in time, if it turns out that I was supposed to apply them to all objects I think it will appear more.

At the moment I use a context menu trigged by a left-click. It's pretty self explanatory. The lights toggle while everything else selects, so for the lights clicking something doesn't always lead to the same result while for the other submenus it does.

I think that the red light source is just super dim, I can definitely see the effects of when it's on and off but just barely.

I don't know how well phong is working... I'm somewhat skeptical. But I do what I can, I guess.
